# Task Management Application using Vue.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/techlab23/task-management-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/techlab23/task-management-app) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/techlab23/task-management-app/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/techlab23/task-management-app)

This is the supporting github repository for **Task Management Application** articles

- [Task Management Application Using Vue.js‚Ää-‚ÄäPart¬†1](https://medium.com/@_shirish/task-management-application-using-vue-js-part-1-df607ca30f48)
- [Task Management Application Using Vue.js - Part 2](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/task-management-application-using-vue-js-part-2-d785a96acda6)

The app allows you to manage projects and tasks visually using board. One board represents one project. A board contains one or more lists. Each list represents the category of tasks, such as Todo, Doing and Done. You can drag-n-drop to change the order of lists, the order of tasks inside the list, and also move task from one list to another as well- to manage the project as it moves through different stages.
